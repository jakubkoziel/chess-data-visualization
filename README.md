# Chess data visualization app

It is an application created in spring to visualize data obtained from https://lichess.org/api.

One can use it to go through most popular moves prefered by website users, chess grandmasters or chess engine for better experience of studying chess. 
Few tabs are intended to show best moves by creating arrows over the board. Moves can be made throughout the input box or by selecting them from table.

Further tabs are user's statistics presented with ChartJS.
